This directory contains a sequential implementation, lab2-seq.c,
three images (small, big, and huge), and a skeletal version,
lab2-base.c, for your implementation.  If you prefer, you may start
with lab2-seq.c.

I'm giving you a sequential version so that you (a) have a reference,
(b) feel compelled to do something in parallel, and (c) don't spend
a lot of time creating a sequential version.  It took me a little
over an hour to get it working.  It's fun to play with.

The Makefile in this directory makes the sequential version.
